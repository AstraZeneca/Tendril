# Tendril
This repository contains R package code for calculating tendril plots.

The Tendril plot is a novel visual summary of the incidence, significance and
temporal aspects of adverse events in clinical trials. The Tendril plot is
inspired and repurposed from a striking artwork [Notabilia](http://notabilia.net/)
that visualizes the temporal flow of Wikipedia discussions on whether to keep
or delete articles. Our implementation of this visualization evaluates each
type of adverse event (AE) in sequence, producing a collection of branches that
effectively summarizes the time-resolved safety profile of a clinical trial â€“
within a single plot.
