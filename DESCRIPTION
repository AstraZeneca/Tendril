Description: The Tendril package provide functionalities to compute the
    coordinates to produce a tendril plot. In the tendril plot, each tendril
    (branch) represents a type of events, and the direction of the tendril is
    dictated by on which treatment arm the event is occurring. If an event is
    occurring on the first of the two specified treatment arms, the tendril bends
    in a clockwise direction. If an event is occurring on the second of the treatment arms, the
    tendril bends in an anti-clockwise direction.
