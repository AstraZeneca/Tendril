Description: Compute the coordinates to produce a tendril plot. 
    In the tendril plot, each tendril (branch) represents a type of events, 
    and the direction of the tendril is dictated by on which treatment arm the 
    event is occurring. If an event is occurring on the first of the two 
    specified treatment arms, the tendril bends in a clockwise direction. 
    If an event is occurring on the second of the treatment arms, the
    tendril bends in an anti-clockwise direction.
